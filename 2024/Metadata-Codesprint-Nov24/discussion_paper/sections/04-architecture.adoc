== High-Level Architecture

As illustrated in <<img_architecture>>, the sprint architecture is somewhat loose - to identify what aspects of metadata standardisation the community considers necessary, but also to explore the commonalities and principles that can be discovered from current activities.

It was not assumed that specific standards could be developed not tested thoroughly, however the general principle of extending multiple metadata standards with extensions based on common models was prioritised, with a focus on Provenance.  Provenance represents a complex challenge with a well-known conceptual model, so testing if a solution to this complex challenge can be successfully re-used provides clear direction to the problems of extending metadata standards for any specific aspects.

The key *methodology* used was the testing of examples based on prior work to model a reusable JSON schema for PROV-O with a ready-to-use JSON-LD semantic mapping, thus encapsulating a complex problem to make implementation feasible. Some codesprint activities tested the feasibility of re-use of such an extension.

<<img_relationships>> illustrates some of the key metadata standards discussed and how they might relate as extension, profiles or mappings.
